## Object Oriented Programming Pratice


#### Abstraction <br>
Data abstraction refers to, providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.

#### Inheritance <br>
One of the most useful aspects of object-oriented programming is code reusability. As the name suggests Inheritance is the process of forming a new class from an existing class that is from the existing class called as base class, new class is formed called as derived class.

This is a very important concept of object-oriented programming since this feature helps to reduce the code size.

#### Polymorphism <br>
The ability to use an operator or function in different ways in other words giving different meaning or functions to the operators or functions is called polymorphism. Poly refers to many. That is a single function or an operator functioning in many ways different upon the usage is called polymorphism.

#### Encapsulation <br>
Wrapping up (combining) data and functions into a single unit is known as encapsulation.

#### Constructors <br>
A constructor is used to construct and initialize all the data members for objects.
